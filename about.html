            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>For all of my life I lived in the rural town of Hartland Michigan. I graduated from Hartland High School in 2019 and soon after attended Michigan State University in hopes of studying Computer Science but am now studying Information Science. My family consists of my two loving parents and younger brother Evan.</p>
            <p>Some of my hobbies include:</p> 
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>Producing Music</li>
            <li>Working Out</li>
            <li>Collecting Shoes</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>I hope to graduate in 2023 with a bachelors degree in Information Science and find the career that suits me best.</p>
