            <h2>Most Expensive Activities</h2>
            <p><h3>Published October 13th, 2021 by Andrew Ruf</h3></p>
            <p>If you’re looking for some luxurious activities, there are many to do throughout the world. Ranging from a few thousand to multi-million-dollar services, there is endless fun to be had. </p>
            <p>If you want to look stylish on the water, many coastal cities have yacht rentals costing upwards to 2,500 dollars for an hour. If dry land is more of your style, at SpeedVegas in Las Vegas you can pick between 8 super cars and test drive them for an hour of adrenaline-pumping fun.</p>
            <p>If you plan on visiting Florida and are looking to relax, you can take an Evian water bath. This spa treatment approximately costs 5,000 dollars and is exclusive to south Florida. Looking to make some big returns instead? Many casinos across the world offer private poker matches exclusive to high stakes betters and require buy-ins ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 dollars.</p>
            <p>If you prefer fine-dining, Serendipity 3 in New York City offers a 1,000-dollar golf-infused sundae. The rather small sundae takes 2 to 3 days to assemble, so you must call ahead to place an order. Instead of blowing 1,000 dollars on ice cream, you can visit Tokyo Ritz-Carlton in Tokyo offers a martini for a small price of 25,000 dollars. A small one-carat diamond is placed at the bottom of the martini, so be careful not to swallow it.</p>

            <h2>Cheapest Activities</h2>
            <p><h3>Published October 14th, 2021 by Andrew Ruf</h3></p>
            <p>If you’re bored and are looking for things to do, but without being costly, there are various activities you can do. </p>
            <p>Craving the movies? Have an at-home movie night with any food or beverages you want, minus the steep concession stand prices. Rent a movie from your local Redbox or load up your favorite streaming service and pick a movie and grab some microwavable popcorn and your night of fun will be under 10 dollars. If you’d like to be outside instead, gather some friends up and go camping for a night. It’s relatively easy to pick up cheap ingredients for meals and find a campground nearby.</p>
            <p>Want to get active with your night? Visit your local park by yourself or with friends and play a sport. You could play laid-back lawn games or go all-out in a 3 versus 3 pickup basketball game; the possibilities are endless. If you feel like giving back to your community you can participate, there are many things you can do. From helping stock a food pantry or even just coaching a youth sports team, there are tons of ways to give back.</p>
            <p>If you’re seeking adventure instead of laying back, there are plenty of activities at your doorstep. Grab some friends and go Geocaching. Geocaching is almost like a treasure map, and if you have a device with a GPS, you can discover many treasures people have placed in specific and at times tricky spots. If your wardrobe needs some additions, another option you have is to go thrifting. Thrift stores such as Goodwill have large selections of used clothing for discounted prices which makes for some good shopping fun. </p>
